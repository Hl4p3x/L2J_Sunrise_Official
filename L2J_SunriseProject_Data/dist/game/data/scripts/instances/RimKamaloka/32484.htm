Only those who have had dreams, may enter into a neighborhood Kamaloka. I'm talking about what comes out of the darkness that seeks to destroy. <br>
If you have had a dream, it should remain in your heart, and you can enter in the neighborhood Kamaloka. <br>
(In District Kamaloka can enter only at the activated Premium <font color="LEVEL"> once a day </font>.) <br>
